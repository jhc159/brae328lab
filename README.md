2. Collision detection

Now you are going to build an automatic vehicle collision detection system. Change the delay time between acceleration measurements to 2 ms. If any acceleration signals beyond ±2.8g are detected, blink the onboard LED for three seconds, otherwise do nothing.

Try if/else statement to develop this collision detection system. Then try while statement and build the same collision detection system.

prompt
update arduino_vehicle_collision:

read every 2m/s

if: acceleration ±2.8g, blink onboard led 3 sec else: nothing

create if/else variation and while variation
